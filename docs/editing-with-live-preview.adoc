= Editing with Live Preview

Here's a quick way to setup live preview of AsciiDoc (or any markup language) using available tools on Linux.
At the very least you'll need Ruby, a web browser and a text editor.

== File monitor

The first step is to setup a file monitor to watch for changes.
We'll use http://rubydoc.info/gems/guard/frames[Guard] for that task.
Install Guard and the shell file monitor using:

 gem install guard guard-shell rb-inotify

You'll need http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] to process the document.
Install Asciidoctor using:

 gem install asciidoctor

Next, create a file named +Guardfile+ in the same directory as your document.
Configure +Guardfile+ to monitor the file (or files) you are editing and then regenerate the HTML file whenever a change is detected.

Here's an example of a basic Guard configuration for monitoring a single file:

.Guardfile
[source, ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor'
require 'erb'

guard 'shell' do
  watch(/^mydoc.adoc$/) {|m|
    Asciidoctor.render_file(m[0], :in_place => true)
  } 
end
----

Now start Guard:

 guard start

Whenever Guard detects a change in the +mydoc.adoc+ file, Asciidoctor will process it using its render API and update (overwrite) the +mydoc.html+ file.

TIP: Instead of monitoring a single file, you can monitor all files matching a glob expression.
In the +watch+ block, replace +mydoc.adoc+ with +*.adoc+ to monitor all files that end in +.adoc+ in the current directory.

== Web preview

Next, install http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/[Epiphany] (now called Web).

TIP: Alternatively, you can use any browser with an auto-refresh plugin.
Epiphany just happens to do it out of the box by monitoring the file system for changes (similar to how Guard works).

Open Epiphany (Web) (or your web browser of choice w/ the auto-refresh plugin) and navigate to the +mydoc.html+ file.
Also open up the source file in your editor.
Put the windows side-by-side so that you can see both of them.
(Use Alt+F5 to unmaximize Epiphany (Web) if you don't see the draggable window frame).

Once the two windows are tiled, make a change to the source document.
Observe that the preview is automatically updated without affecting the scroll offset.

== Survey says...

Asciidoctor + Guard + Epiphany (Web) == Doc writing pleasure!

== Alternative options

If you want to setup this environment using Chrome or Firefox, you can try out the https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload[Guard::LiveReload plugin] and the companion LiveReload extension for https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en[Chrome] or https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/livereload/[Firefox]. If haven't been able to get LiveReload to work yet, but it sounds promising.
