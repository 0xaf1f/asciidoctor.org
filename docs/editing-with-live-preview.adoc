Here's a quick way to setup live preview of AsciiDoc (or any markup language) using available tools on Linux. At the very least you'll need Ruby, a web browser and a text editor.

== File monitor

The first step is to setup a file monitor to watch for changes. We'll use http://rubydoc.info/gems/guard/frames[Guard] for that task. Install it using:

 gem install guard

Create a Guardfile in the same directory as your document. Configure it to monitor the file (or files) you are editing and to regenerate the HTML file whenever a change is detected in the source.

Here's an example of a basic Guardfile for monitoring a single file:

[source, ruby]
----
require 'asciidoctor'
require 'erb'

guard 'shell' do
  watch(/^mydoc.adoc$/) {|m|
    Asciidoctor.render_file(m[0], :in_place => true)
  } 
end
----

Of course, you'll need http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] installed to process the document. Install it using:

 gem install asciidoctor

Now start Guard:

 guard start

Whenever Guard detects a change in the +mydoc.adoc+ file, Asciidoctor will process it using its render API and update (overwrite) the +mydoc.html+ file.

TIP: Instead of monitoring a single file, you can monitor all files matching a glob expression. In the +watch+ block, substitute +mydoc.adoc+ with +*.adoc+ to monitor all files ending in +.adoc+ in the current directory.

== Web preview

Next, install http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/[Epiphany] (now called Web).

TIP: Alternatively, you can use any browser with an auto-refresh plugin. Epiphany just happens to do it out of the box by monitoring the file system for changes (similar to how Guard works).

Open Epiphany (Web) (or your web browser of choice w/ the auto-refresh plugin) and navigate to the +mydoc.html+ file. Also open up the source file in your editor. Put the windows side-by-side so that you can see both of them. (Use Alt+F5 to unmaximize Epiphany (Web) if you don't see the draggable window frame).

Once the two windows are tiled, make a change to the source document. Observe that the preview is automatically updated without affecting the scroll offset.

Asciidoctor + Guard + Epiphany (Web) == Doc writing pleasure!
